// Notes from Codewars

// Array.split("") takes something from a string seperated by nothing to array
// Array.join takes something from an array to string
// parseInt() for string to int and toString() for opposite
// check if something is inside arr, includes()
// ******* Need to learn map, reduce, and filter better ********
