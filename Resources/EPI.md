# Elements of Programming Interviews in Python - Notes

## Plan
- ~~Go through the book in iterations like sprints instead of slowly chapter by chapter.~~ Go through Ch.1-18 chapter by chapter. At 2 problems per day, that's 60 problems per month and would mean I'd be done in 4 months.
- "Focusing only on a single topic for a good amount of time will make you an expert in a much shorter amount of time than spreading your focus and jumping from discipline to discipline."

## Chapter 1 - Intro
- Use EPI judge and discussion group on their site
- Go through the book in iterations
- Update Github

## Chapter 2 - Strategies for a good interview

- Learn the Python collections library

### How to approach problems

1. Clarify the question (walk thru sample input and output)
2. Have an example in mind when solving
3. Spell out the brute force solution
4. Think out loud
5. Apply common patterns (divide and conquer, ect)
