# Welcome to the Coding Interview - You Suck

These are my key takeaways from this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKirumpmwDWTtKCJKn2HuoQ2NavEfR41whmTyaQcio4/edit#).

- I'm at a beginner level right now because I don't even know all the basic data structures yet (still missing Sorting, Recursion, Dp, Graphs, and Greedy Algorithms)
- It takes a long time to really understand data structures well, 200+ leetcode questions
- It's not a game of luck, it's mostly a game of practice
- Deliberate and consistent practice is how people become good at something.
- Play the long game. I'm going to be interviewing in now and later this year, make sure I'm 200% ready for August and use interviews in March-June as practice.

### Reasons why someone would suck
- Approach is not consistent
- You're practicing incorrectly
- You're not fast enough
